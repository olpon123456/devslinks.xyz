          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a><br />

          Visual Studio Code, or VS Code, is a super popular code editor developed by Microsoft. It's lightweight, fast, and supports tons of programming languages right out of the box. You can add features using extensions — everything from themes to full-blown language packs. The built-in terminal and Git integration make your workflow smooth and efficient. It’s great for beginners but powerful enough for pros. Plus, it’s free and constantly updated by a vibrant community.

          <ul class="pros-cons">
            <li class="pro">✔️ Free and open source</li>
            <li class="pro">✔️ Vast extension ecosystem</li>
            <li class="pro">✔️ Strong support for many languages</li>
            <li class="con">❌ Slower with heavy extensions</li>

GitHub is like the social media of code, where developers collaborate, store projects, and share ideas. It's built on Git, which helps manage different versions of your code. You can contribute to open-source projects, showcase your work, or team up with others. The interface is clean and beginner-friendly, even if Git itself takes a little learning. GitHub also powers GitHub Pages, Actions, and Codespaces — making it much more than a code repository. If you're coding in 2025, GitHub is pretty much essential.
